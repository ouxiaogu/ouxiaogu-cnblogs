I used the **SyntaxHighlighter** by http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/ .

I like it a lot， but I encounter a problem show below, it's a piece of code captured in Chrome/FireFox ：

![enter image description here][1]

The extra line in the end is not because line "10" convert to  the "1" and "0" （So this solution didn't work out with me. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804789/extra-lines-using-syntaxhighlighter-for-chrome-only/11850041#11850041）.

**It is because my line space in code is not the same with the line number space on the left。**
I was wonder if there is anybody find the some problem of mine , and how can I fix it?
